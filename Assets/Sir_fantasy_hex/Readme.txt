Additional landscape environment (trees, rocks, bridge etc). 

Army characters are ready for Mecanim (no animations in this pack, you can use Mixamo). 

Helpful tip: hex snaping. In demo scenes you can see gameobject GridEditor. Select it and you see HexGridEditorScript. This script creates hex grid on scene by specified width and height. When this grid created you can select any object on scene(hex for example), click Ctrl+G and selected objects will be snaped to nearest hex of grid. This is very helpful for hex lay out.
See script SnapToGrid.cs in code folder for more information and tuning.
